        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>A child prodigy</p>
            Joshua Bell was born in Bloomington, Indiana, on 9 December 1967. He
            began taking violin lessons at the age of four after his mother
            discovered that he had stretched rubber bands across the handles of
            his dresser drawer to pluck out music he had heard her play on the
            piano.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Soloist at 14</p>
            At the age of 14, Bell appeared as a soloist with the Philadelphia
            Orchestra conducted by Riccardo Muti. He studied the violin at the
            Indiana University Jacobs School of Music and went on to receive an
            Artist Diploma in Violin Performance from Indiana University in
            1989.
          </li>
          <li>

            At 17, Bell made his Carnegie Hall debut with the St. Louis Symphony
            Orchestra. He has since performed with many of the world's major
            orchestras and conductors.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Best-selling recording artist</p>
            An exclusive recording artist for Sony Classical, Joshua Bell has

            18 on the Decca label. /li>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Champion of new works</p>
            As well as playing the standard repertoire, Bell has performed many
            new works. Nicholas Maw's violin concerto is dedicated to Bell, who
            premiered it in 1993 and won a Grammy Award for his recording.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Award-winning instrumentalist</p>
            Bell has won numerous awards including a Gramophone Award in 1998
            for his recording of the Barber and Walton violin concertos. He is
            pictured here performing during the Classical BRIT Awards at the
            Royal Albert Hall
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>A 300-year old Stradivarius</p>
            Joshua Bell's instrument is a 300-year old Stradivarius violin
            called the 'Gibson ex Huberman', which was made in 1713 during what
            is known as Stradivari's Golden Era. The violin had been stolen
            twice from the previous owner, Bronis≈Çaw Huberman; the final time
            the thief confessed to the act on his deathbed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Performer of film scores</p>
            Bell performed the violin solo for the Oscar-winning soundtrack for
            'The Red Violin' and was also featured in the scores for 'Ladies in
            Lavender', 'Angels & Demons', 'Iris' and 'Defiance'. He is pictured
            here with singer Michael Buble at the after party following the New
            York premiere of 'The Devil Wears Prada'.

          <li>
            <p>The anonymous busker</p>
            In an experiment conducted by 'The Washington Post', Bell performed
            as an incognito busker at a metro station in Washington D.C. on 12
            January 2007. Of the more than 1000 people who passed by, only seven
            stopped to listen, and only one recognised him. He collected just
            $32.17 from 27 people (excluding $20 from the woman who recognised
            him).
